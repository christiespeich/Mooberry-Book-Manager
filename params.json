However, as there are infinite possibilities when developing themes and little required standardization, so some themes may not work as expected with the plugin. If Mooberry Book Manager isn’t working for your theme, [contact us](http://www.mooberrydreams.com/contact/) and we’ll see if we can help.\r\n\r\nWe have found issues when using Mooberry Book Manager with the Customizr theme. These issues should be resolved with v1.1.\r\n\r\n### What’s the difference between Download Links and Retailer Links? \r\n\r\nDownload Links should be used when you are allowing readers to download the book for free.\r\n\r\nRetailer Links are used when you are linking to website for readers to purchase your book.\r\n\r\nA single book most likely won’t have both Download Links and Retailer Links, unless your book is listed for free at retailers and you are also allowing readers to download the ebooks directly from your website.\r\n\r\n### What link do I use for download links? How will my readers download the files? \r\n\r\nYour ebook files will need to be uploaded somewhere. You have a few options:  \r\n1. Upload to a public storage website such as Dropbox.  \r\n2. Upload directly to your website via FTP.  \r\n3. Upload to your website via Wordpress' Media Libary. **Note:** Wordpress does not allow you to upload .epub and .mobi files. You'll need to compress them into .zip files before uploading.  \r\n\r\nThe link you enter on the book page should point directly to the file to download.\r\n\r\n### Can I use affiliate links? \r\nOf course! Mooberry Book Manager doesn’t change your link, so you can set your Retailer Links to use your Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or other affiliate code.\r\n\r\n### Why is there no Author field? \r\nMooberry Book Manager is designed to be used by the author on the author's website. In this case, the author name would always be the same, and it's already written all over the website.\r\n\r\nThere are cases though when you might want to have an Author field. You might be an author who publishes under multiple pen names and has a single website. You might be a small publisher who works with multiple authors. Or you might not be an author at all, and using Mooberry Book Manager for a different purpose, such as for a book club. In those cases you have two options:\r\n\r\n1. To simply display the author name, you could use another field, such as Subtitle, to display that information.\r\n\r\n2. For more advanced handling of author names, use the Mooberry Book Manager Multi-Author plugin (coming soon). This will allow you to have a bio and photo of each author as well as advanced filtering and sorting on Book Grids based on author.\r\n\r\n## Additional questions?  \r\nDownload the [User Manual](http://www.mooberrydreams.com/support/mooberry-book-manager-support/) (PDF format)\r\n\r\n## Coming Soon  \r\n\r\n* Mooberry Book Manager Media Kit -- automagically create a media kit and get help writing press releases for your books  \r\n* Mooberry Book Manager Multi-Author -- support multiple authors, useful for small publishers or authors with more than one pen name  \r\n* Mooberry Book Manager Customizer -- customize the book pages and more  \r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for a new add-on, feel free to email me at bookmanager@mooberrydreams.com. \r\n\r\n## Want regular updates? \r\n* Like Mooberry Dreams on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MooberryDreams\r\n* Follow Mooberry Dreams on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MooberryDreams\r\n* Check out the blog: http://www.mooberrydreams.com/blog\r\n* Subscribe to Mooberry Dreams' mailing list: http://www.mooberrydreams.com/products/mooberry-book-manager/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
