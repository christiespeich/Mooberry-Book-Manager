## Description
An easy-to-use system for authors. Add your new book to your site in less than 5 minutes.


No coding is necessary to use Mooberry Book Manager. Adding books is as easy as filling out a form. Include as much or as little information as you want, including the book cover, links to purchase the book, reviews of the book, an excerpt, and more.

Mooberry Book Manager will create a page for each book, ensuring a consistent look on all of your pages.

Organize your book into grids with just a few clicks. Grids can include all of your books or a selection of books, and you choose how they are ordered. You can create multiple grids; for example, an "Available Now" page and a "Coming Soon" page. Grids update automatically when you edit or add books. Set it and forget it!

Feature books on your sidebar with four options:
* A random book  
* The newest book  
* A book that's coming soon  
* A specific book  
	
Mooberry Book Manager works with your chosen theme to provide a consistent look throughout your website.

Requires Wordpress 3.8. The admin screens (for creating books, etc.) require Javascript, but the public pages do not.

##Getting Started with Mooberry Book Manager  
After installing and activating Mooberry Book Manager, you'll now have a Books menu.  Use that to add your books to your website.

In order for your books to appear on your website, you need to add a Book Grid and/or a Widget.

To Add a Book Grid:  
* Create a new Page or edit an existing one  
* Scroll down to the Book Grid Settings section  
* Choose the books, grouping, and sort order  
* Save the page and view it. Click on any book cover to get details of the book  

To Add a Widget:  
* Go to Appearance -> Widget  
* Drag the Mooberry Book Manager Book Widget to the Widget Area of your choice  
* Choose the book to display  
* Save the widget and view your website. Click on the book cover to get the details of the book.
