#How to use the pot file#

The pot file included in this folder is ready to use.

1. Start up Poedit.

If starting a new translation:
    2. In Poedit goto File -> New from POT/PO file...
    3. Select and Open the pot file from the languages folder.
    4. Enter your name, email address, your language and country (i.e. French fr_FR, German de_DE) to the setting form.
    5. Click the Update button in the main Poedit UI.

If updating an existing PO file for your language:
    2. In Poedit go to File -> Open...
    3. Select and Open the po file from the languages folder
    4. In Poedit go to Translation -> Update from POT File...    (** In older versions this menu is called Catalog)
    5. Select and Open the pot file from the languages folder

6. Enter your translations

7. Save the file:
	- For a plugin like filename-xx_XX.po with xx_XX for your language and country.
	- For a theme xx_XX.po with xx_XX for your language and country.

8. That's it, go to your WordPress blog and see your translation in action.

9. Email the plugin/theme author your po file so it can be included in future updates for all users.
