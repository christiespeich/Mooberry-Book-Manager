Sell books via Amazon and other retailers directly from your author website with this easy-to-use system. Creates book pages, widgets, and book grids.

== Description ==

Mooberry Book Manager is an easy-to-use system for authors to add books to their Wordpress websites.

No coding is necessary to use Mooberry Book Manager. Adding books is as easy as filling out a form. Include as much or as little information as you want, including the book cover, links to purchase the book, reviews of the book, an excerpt, and more.

Each book can be linked to as many book store retailers to you want. You can even use your affiliate links!

Mooberry Book Manager will create a page for each book, ensuring a consistent look on all of your pages.

Organize your book into grids with just a few clicks. Grids can include all of your books or a selection of books, and you choose how they are ordered. You can create multiple grids; for example, an "Available Now" page and a "Coming Soon" page. Grids update automatically when you edit or add books. Set it and forget it!

Feature books on your sidebar with four options:

* A random book

* The newest book

* A book that's coming soon

* A specific book

Mooberry Book Manager works with your chosen theme to provide a consistent look throughout your website.

Requires Wordpress 3.8+ and Javascript.


**Getting Started with Mooberry Book Manager**

After installing and activating Mooberry Book Manager, you'll now have a Books menu.  Use that to add your books to your website.

In order for your books to appear on your website, you need to add a Book Grid and/or a Widget.

*To Add a Book Grid:*

* Go to Book Grids -> Add New

* Give the Book Grid a name to help you remember what kind of grid it is

* Choose the books, grouping, and sort order

* Save the grid. You will be shown a shortcode.  Copy the entire shortcode.

* On any page, blog post, etc. paste the shortcode into the text editor.

* Save your page and view it. Click on any book to see the details of the book.


*To Add a Widget:*

* Go to Appearance -> Widget

* Drag the Mooberry Book Manager Book Widget to the Widget Area of your choice

* Choose the book to display

* Save the widget and view your website. Click on the book cover to get the details of the book.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Mooberry Book Manager work with my theme? =

Mooberry Book Manager has been designed to be theme-independent and should work for most themes. However, as there are infinite possibilities when developing themes and little required standardization, so some themes may not work as expected with the plugin. If Mooberry Book Manager isn’t working for your theme, [contact us](http://www.mooberrydreams.com/contact/) and we’ll see if we can help.

We have found issues when using Mooberry Book Manager with the Customizr theme. These issues should be resolved with v1.1.

Many theme incompatibilities should be solved with v3.0. If you continue to find problems with your theme, please [contact us](http://www.mooberrydreams.com/contact/).

= What’s the difference between Download Links and Retailer Links? =

Download Links should be used when you are allowing readers to download the book for free.

Retailer Links are used when you are linking to website for readers to purchase your book.

A single book most likely won’t have both Download Links and Retailer Links, unless your book is listed for free at retailers and you are also allowing readers to download the ebooks directly from your website.

= What link do I use for download links? How will my readers download the files? =

Your ebook files will need to be uploaded somewhere. You have a few options:
1. Upload to a public storage website such as Dropbox.
2. Upload directly to your website via FTP.
3. Upload to your website via Wordpress' Media Libary. **Note:** Wordpress does not allow you to upload .epub and .mobi files. You'll need to compress them into .zip files before uploading.

The link you enter on the book page should point directly to the file to download.

= Can I use affiliate links? =
Of course! Mooberry Book Manager doesn’t change your link, so you can set your Retailer Links to use your Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or other affiliate code.

On the Moobery Book Manager Settings -> Retailers page you can list an affiliate code for each retailer. For example, Amazon’s code would look something like this:

?tag=<your-affiliate-id>

Different retailers and affiliate programs use different ways of formatting the links for tracking affiliates. Choose the method your program uses.

If your affiliate links look like this, choose After Book Link:

http://www.retailerwebsite.com/link/to/book/someAffiliateCode

If your affiliate links look like this, choose Before Book Link:

http://www.affiliatewebsite.com/someAffiliateCode/http://www.retailerwebsite.com/link/to/book

(Hint: For Amazon, use After Book Link.)

Once you enter your affiliate codes into the Retailers Settings screen, all of your book links will automatically use any affiliate codes that apply. So, if you entered an affiliate code for Amazon, every book that has an Amazon buy link will use that code in the link.

= Why is there no Author field? =
Mooberry Book Manager is designed to be used by the author on the author's website. In this case, the author name would always be the same, and it's already written all over the website.

There are cases though when you might want to have an Author field. You might be an author who publishes under multiple pen names and has a single website. You might be a small publisher who works with multiple authors. Or you might not be an author at all, and using Mooberry Book Manager for a different purpose, such as for a book club. In those cases you have two options:

1. To simply display the author name, you could use another field, such as Subtitle, to display that information.

2. For more advanced handling of author names, use the [Mooberry Book Manager Multi-Author plugin] (http://www.mooberrybookmanager.com/downloads/multi-author/). This will allow you to have a bio and photo of each author as well as advanced filtering and sorting on Book Grids based on author.

= Does Mooberry Book Manager work with Wordpress Multi-Site? =

Versions 2.4.4 and earlier work with Wordpress Multi-Site if you **don't** use Network Activation. If each blog activates Mooberry Book Manager themselves, it should work.

Versions 3.0 - 3.0.4 does **not** work with Wordpress Multi-Site in any way.

Versions 3.1 and above work with Wordpress Multi-Site both with and without Network Activation.

= Does Mooberry Book Manager work with caching plugins? =

See the **Other Notes** section for information about using caching plugins with Mooberry Book Manager.

For revision history of older versions, please see changelog.md


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.2 =
Updated for Wordpress 4.3!

= 2.1 =
Responsive Book Grids and more!

= 2.0 =
Redesigned, responsive book page and much more!

== Other Notes ==
= Multi-Site Compatibility =

* **Versions 2.4.4 and earlier** work with Wordpress Multi-Site if you **don't** use Network Activation. If each blog activates Mooberry Book Manager themselves, it should work.

* **Versions 3.0 - 3.0.4** do **not** work with Wordpress Multi-Site in any way.

* **Versions 3.1 and above** work with Wordpress Multi-Site both with and without Network Activation.

= Caching Plugins Compatibility =

**Versions 2.4.4 and earlier** should work with caching plugins as-is. If your book pages or book grids aren't refreshing when you add/update a book, you may need to manually clear your cache.

**Versions 3.0 - 3.0.4** do **not** work with W3C Total Cache. An error will be thrown. These versions work okay with WP Super Cache.

**Versions 3.1 and above** work with both W3C Total Cache and WP Super Cache with the following notes:

* **W3C Total Cache** - You must turn on Object Caching in W3C Total Cache's settings for Mooberry Book Manager data to be cached. Book data cache is automatically cleared when a book is updated, added, or deleted so your book pages and grids should stay up-to-date.

* **WP Super Cache** - When a book is updated, added, or deleted, the cache for the entire site is cleared. Unfortunately, WP Super Cache does not seem to have an option for selectively clearing some cache and not all of it.

* Use another caching plugin?  If you are having problems using it with Mooberry Book Manager, please [contact us](http://www.mooberrydreams.com/contact/) and let us know what plugin you are using and what the issue is.
