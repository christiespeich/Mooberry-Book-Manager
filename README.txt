An easy-to-use system for authors. Add your new book to your site in less than 5 minutes.

== Description ==

Mooberry Book Manager is an easy-to-use system for authors to add books to their Wordpress websites.

No coding is necessary to use Mooberry Book Manager. Adding books is as easy as filling out a form. Include as much or as little information as you want, including the book cover, links to purchase the book, reviews of the book, an excerpt, and more.

Mooberry Book Manager will create a page for each book, ensuring a consistent look on all of your pages.

Organize your book into grids with just a few clicks. Grids can include all of your books or a selection of books, and you choose how they are ordered. You can create multiple grids; for example, an "Available Now" page and a "Coming Soon" page. Grids update automatically when you edit or add books. Set it and forget it!

Feature books on your sidebar with four options:   

* A random book    

* The newest book    

* A book that's coming soon   

* A specific book   
	
Mooberry Book Manager works with your chosen theme to provide a consistent look throughout your website.

Requires Wordpress 3.8. The admin screens (for creating books, etc.) require Javascript, but the public pages do not.

Mooberry Book Manager can be translated into other languages! See `Other Notes` for more information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Mooberry Book Manager work with my theme? =

Mooberry Book Manager has been designed to be theme-independent and should work for most themes. However, as there are infinite possibilities when developing themes and little required standardization, so some themes may not work as expected with the plugin. If Mooberry Book Manager isn’t working for your theme, [contact us](http://www.mooberrydreams.com/contact/) and we’ll see if we can help.

We have found issues when using Mooberry Book Manager with the Customizr theme. These issues should be resolved with v1.1.

= What’s the difference between Download Links and Retailer Links? =

Download Links should be used when you are allowing readers to download the book for free.

Retailer Links are used when you are linking to website for readers to purchase your book.

A single book most likely won’t have both Download Links and Retailer Links, unless your book is listed for free at retailers and you are also allowing readers to download the ebooks directly from your website.

= What link do I use for download links? How will my readers download the files? =

Your ebook files will need to be uploaded somewhere. You have a few options:  
1. Upload to a public storage website such as Dropbox.  
2. Upload directly to your website via FTP.  
3. Upload to your website via Wordpress' Media Libary. **Note:** Wordpress does not allow you to upload .epub and .mobi files. You'll need to compress them into .zip files before uploading.  

The link you enter on the book page should point directly to the file to download.

= Can I use affiliate links? =
Of course! Mooberry Book Manager doesn’t change your link, so you can set your Retailer Links to use your Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or other affiliate code.

= Why is there no Author field? =
Mooberry Book Manager is designed to be used by the author on the author's website. In this case, the author name would always be the same, and it's already written all over the website.

There are cases though when you might want to have an Author field. You might be an author who publishes under multiple pen names and has a single website. You might be a small publisher who works with multiple authors. Or you might not be an author at all, and using Mooberry Book Manager for a different purpose, such as for a book club. In those cases you have two options:

1. To simply display the author name, you could use another field, such as Subtitle, to display that information.

2. For more advanced handling of author names, use the Mooberry Book Manager Multi-Author plugin (coming soon). This will allow you to have a bio and photo of each author as well as advanced filtering and sorting on Book Grids based on author.
